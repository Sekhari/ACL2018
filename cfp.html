	<h1>ALT 2018 - Call for Papers</h1>
	
The 29th International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT
2018) will be held in Lanzarote, Spain, on April 7-9, 2018.
The conference will be co-located with 
<a href="http://www.aistats.org" target="_blank">
AISTATS 2018</a>, which immediately follows ALT 2018.
<p>
  We invite submissions addressing all theoretical aspects of machine learning.
  
The ALT 2018 conference is dedicated to the theoretical foundations of
machine learning. We invite submissions with theoretical and
algorithmic contributions to new or already existing learning problems
including, but not limited to:
</p><ul>
<li>Comparison of the strength of learning models and the design and evaluation 
  of novel algorithms for learning problems in established learning-theoretic 
  settings such as
    <ul>
    <li> Statistical learning theory
    </li><li> Supervised learning and regression       
    </li><li> Statistical learning theory
    </li><li> On-line learning
    </li><li> Inductive inference
    </li><li> Query models
    </li><li> Unsupervised learning
    </li><li> Clustering
    </li><li> Semi-supervised and active learning
    </li><li> Stochastic optimization
    </li><li> High dimensional and non-parametric inference
    </li><li> Exploration-exploitation tradeoff, bandit theory
    </li><li> Reinforcement learning, planning, control
    </li><li> Learning with additional constraints, e.g., communication, time or memory budget, or privacy
    </li></ul>
</li><li>Analysis of the theoretical properties of existing algorithms such as
    <ul>
      <li>Boosting
      </li><li>Kernel-based methods, SVM
      </li><li>Bayesian methods
      </li><li>Graph- and/or manifold-based methods
      </li><li>Methods for latent-variable estimation and/or clustering
      </li><li>Decision tree methods
      </li><li>Information-based methods, MDL
      </li><li>Neural networks
    </li></ul>
Analyses could include generalization, speed of convergence,
computational complexity, or sample complexity.
</li><li>Definition and analysis of new learning models. Models might
identify and formalize classes of learning problems inadequately
addressed by existing theory or capture salient properties of
important concrete applications. 
</li><li>
We are also interested in papers that include viewpoints that are new
to the ALT community. We welcome experimental and algorithmic papers
provided they are relevant to the focus of the conference by
elucidating theoretical results, or by pointing out interesting and
not well understood behavior that could stimulate theoretical analysis.
</li>
</ul>



<h3>Awards</h3>

ALT 2018 will have both a best student paper award (E.M. Gold Award)
and a best paper award. Authors must indicate at submission time if
they wish their paper to be eligible for a student award. This does
not preclude the paper to be eligible for the best paper award
the paper can be co-authored by other researchers.

<h3>Policy</h3>
Each submitted paper will be reviewed by the members of the programme
committee and be judged on clarity, significance and originality.
Joint submissions to other conferences with published proceedings are
not allowed. Papers that have appeared in or are under review for
other conferences are not appropriate for ALT 2018. The same policy
applies to journals, unless the submission is a shorter version of a
paper submitted to a journal and has not yet been published.  It is,
however, acceptable to submit to ALT work that has been made available
as a technical report or similar, for example on http://www.arxiv.org.
<p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

We also invite proposals for a tutorial presentation. These should be
dealing with a learning theory topic covered within two
hours. Proposals are limited to 2 pages and should include a
one page abstract as well as links to any relevant material
such as existing slides or other teaching material.


<h3>Formatting</h3>

There is no page limit for submissions, and submissions should include
all proofs and technical details necessary to understand the results. 
However, referees are not required to read beyond the first 12 pages
when reviewing submissions.  Therefore, it is recommended that the
first 12 pages contain a clear presentation of the papers main
contributions and at least sketches of the main arguments. 

All accepted papers will be published as a volume in the JMLR Workshop
and Conference Proceedings series, and will be available online during
the conference. Submissions should be formatted according to the
instructions on the following page: <a
href="http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html">
http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html</a>.

<h3>Submission</h3>

The reviewing process is <b>not double-blind</b>.  Authors should list their
names and affiliations in their submissions.

Authors can submit their papers electronically via our submission page 
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alt2018">
 https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alt20180</a>
which will be opened for submissions in October 2017.

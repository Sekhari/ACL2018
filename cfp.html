	<h1>ALT 2018 - Call for Papers</h1>
	
The 29th International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT
2018) will be held in Lanzarote, Spain, on April 7-9, 2018.
The conference will be co-located with 
<a href="http://www.aistats.org" target="_blank">
AISTATS 2018</a>, which immediately follows ALT 2018.
<p>
  We invite submissions addressing all theoretical aspects of machine learning.
  
The ALT 2018 conference is dedicated to all theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning. We invite submissions with contributions to new or existing learning problems including, but not limited to:
</p><ul>
<li> Design and analysis of learning algorithms.
</li> <li> Statistical and computational learning theory.
</li> <li> Online learning algorithms and theory.
</li> <li>Optimization methods for learning.
</li> <li>Unsupervised, semi-supervised, online and active learning.
</li> <li>Connections of learning with other mathematical fields.
</li> <li>Artificial neural networks, including deep learning.
</li> <li>High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics.
</li> <li>Learning with algebraic or combinatorial structure.
</li> <li>Bayesian methods in learning.
</li> <li>Planning and control, including reinforcement learning.
</li> <li>Learning with system constraints: e.g. privacy, memory or communication budget.
</li> <li>Learning from complex data: e.g., networks, time series, etc.
</li> <li>Interactions with statistical physics.
</li> <li>Learning in other settings: e.g. social, economic, and game-theoretic. 
</li>
</ul>
We are also interested in papers that include viewpoints that are new
to the ALT community. We welcome experimental and algorithmic papers
provided they are relevant to the focus of the conference by
elucidating theoretical results, or by pointing out an interesting and
not well understood behavior that could stimulate theoretical analysis.




<h3>Awards</h3>

ALT 2018 will have both a <b> best student paper award (E.M. Gold Award) </b>
and a <b> best paper award</b>. Authors must indicate at submission time if
they wish their paper to be eligible for a student award. This does
not preclude the paper to be eligible for the best paper award. The paper can be co-authored by other researchers.

<h3>Policy</h3>
Each submitted paper will be reviewed by the members of the program
committee and be judged on clarity, significance and originality.
Joint submissions to other conferences with published proceedings are
not allowed. Papers that have appeared in or are under review for
other conferences are not appropriate for ALT 2018. The same policy
applies to journals, unless the submission is a shorter version of a
paper submitted to a journal and has not yet been published.  It is,
however, acceptable to submit to ALT work that has been made available
as a technical report or similar, for example on http://www.arxiv.org.
<p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

We also invite proposals for a tutorial presentation. These should be
dealing with a learning theory topic covered within two
hours. Proposals are limited to 2 pages and should include a
one page abstract as well as links to any relevant material
such as existing slides or other teaching material.


<h3>Formatting</h3>

There is no page limit for submissions, and submissions should include
all proofs and technical details necessary to understand the results. 
However, referees are not required to read beyond the first 12 pages
when reviewing submissions.  Therefore, it is recommended that the
first 12 pages contain a clear presentation of the papers main
contributions and at least sketches of the main arguments. 

All accepted papers will be published as a volume in the JMLR Workshop
and Conference Proceedings series, and will be available online during
the conference. Submissions should be formatted according to the
instructions on the following page: <a
href="http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html">
http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html</a>.

<h3>Submission</h3>

The reviewing process is not double-blind.  Authors should list their
names and affiliations in their submissions.

Authors can submit their papers electronically via our submission page 
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alt2018">
 https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alt20180</a>
which will be opened for submissions in October 2017.

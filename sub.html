<b>Format</b>:
There is no page limit for submissions, and submissions should include
all proofs and technical details necessary to understand the results.

<b>Submission Mode</b>: 
The reviewing process is <b>not double-blind</b>.  Authors should list their
names and affiliations in their submissions.
<p>
<b>Policy</b>: 
Each submitted paper will be reviewed by the members of the programme
committee and be judged on clarity, significance and originality.
Joint submissions to other conferences with published proceedings are
not allowed. Papers that have appeared in or are under review for
other conferences are not appropriate for ALT 2017. The same policy
applies to journals, unless the submission is a shorter version of a
paper submitted to a journal and has not yet been published.  It is,
however, acceptable to submit to ALT work that has been made available
as a technical report or similar, for example on http://www.arxiv.org.

and Conference Proceedings series, and will be available online during
the conference.

<b> Rules for Submissions: ALT 2017</b></p><p>
The 29th International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2018) will be held in Lanzarote, Spain, on April 7-9, 2018. 
The conference will be co-located with AISTATS 2018, which immediately follows ALT 2018.

</p><p>
<b>Format</b>:
There is no page limit for submissions, and submissions should include
all proofs and technical details necessary to understand the results. 
However, referees are not required to read beyond the first 12 pages
when reviewing submissions.  Therefore, it is recommended that the
first 12 pages should contain a clear presentation of the papers main
contributions and at least sketches of the main arguments. 
<p>
<b>Formatting</b>:
We will be publishing in the JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings series.

<b>Submission Mode</b>: 
The reviewing process is <b>not double-blind</b>.  Authors should list their
names and affiliations in their submissions.
<p>
<b>Policy</b>: 
Each submitted paper will be reviewed by the members of the programme
committee and be judged on clarity, significance and originality.
Joint submissions to other conferences with published proceedings are
not allowed. Papers that have appeared in or are under review for
other conferences are not appropriate for ALT 2018. The same policy
applies to journals, unless the submission is a shorter version of a
paper submitted to a journal and has not yet been published.  It is,
however, acceptable to submit to ALT work that has been made available
as a technical report or similar, for example on http://www.arxiv.org.
<p>
<b>Proceedings</b>:
All accepted papers will be published as a volume in the JMLR Workshop
and Conference Proceedings series, and will be available online during
the conference.
